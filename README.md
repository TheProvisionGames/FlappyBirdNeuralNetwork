# Run Flappy Bird with AI
#### Learn the basics of neural networks with [Flappy Bird tutorials](https://apple.serpentine.ai/education/flappy_bird)

<br>
Welcome to the Flappy Bird track, where you will learn the fundamentals of neural networks. After completing this track, you will have a fully functioning Flappy Bird game in which the bird is controlled by AI. Along the way, you will also create some mathematical understanding of neural networks. 
In the first tutorial you will set up the programs to get started. The next three tutorials are about neural networks and how to build them. In tutorial 5 and 6 you will use neural networks in the Flappy bird game and improve your AI controlled bird. Tutorial 7 is optional, and gives more mathematical background to optimizing neural networks. Finally, in tutorial 8, you can find an overview of what you have learned in this track. Good luck and have fun making your own Flappy bird!


### File information
This GitHub repository contains files (in the folder *Flappy Bird Game*) and images to run the basics of Flappy Bird. A neural network is applied to fly the bird.

##### main.py
This is the main file from where to run the Flappy Bird game. The main file uses the files below.

##### defs.py
This file contains all start values and variables that will be used while playing the game. 

##### bird.py
This file contains functions in relation to the bird, for example the position of the bird and if it is hitting a pipe or not. 

##### pipe.py
This file contains functions in relation to the pipes, for example the position of pipes and the heightness of them. 

##### nnet.py
This file contains the neural network structure for running Flappy Bird using AI.
